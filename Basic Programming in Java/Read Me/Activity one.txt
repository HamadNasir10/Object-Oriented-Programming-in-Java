Activity One

1. When changed the name of class such as ActivityTwo it gives the following error: ActivityTwo  is public, should be declared in a file named ActivityTwo.java
   public class ActivityTwo {. File name should be same as class name.
2. When bracket removed it showed compiler error.It gives error: error: '{' expected
   public class ActivityOne and for second error:error: '}' expecte public class ActivityOne.
3. When used lower case 's' instead of 'S' it gived compiler error. Because System was case sensitive and it can't be changed.
4.By removing semicolon it gived compiler error because it is must.
