Activity One:
            It is a program which inputs two numbers from the user and tell the relationship between them. It tells wether one
number is greater,equal,smaller,not equal,greater and equal,smaller and equal then other number.

Activity Two: 
           In this program there was logical error which is that value of x was not incremented and hence the compiler compiled
the program but it was not giving the desired output so it was not syntax error. Thus by writing x++ in while loop value of x was
incremented up to 10 and thus was added.

Activity Three:
              This program prints the square of numbers from 1 to 10 and then prints the sum of those squared numbers.

Activity Four:
              This program first prints all the cards of the deck. Then the function introduced shuffles the cards and prints them.
